                        <p>An increasing number of foundations are exploring the utility of MRIs. This article is
                            intended to help provide a framework for the careful consideration of the issues. MRIs may not
                            be for every foundation, but they can function as an additional tool for a foundation to have
                            desired charitable impact while also earning an investment return. A MRI Policy can be useful
                            both as a reference for the board and staff members of a foundation and as a tool to ensure that
                            the legal and implementation issues associated with MRIs are addressed.
